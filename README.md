# frequencySweep
Sweeps frequency of a Stanford Lock-in, takes data, and manipulates data into a new format.


These programs were written using LabVIEW and were used to measure the frequency dependence of a device prototype that I created. The data is saved to a general text file with a convenient format, but for better visualization I created a program to manipulate and change the format to view some of the different dependencies.
